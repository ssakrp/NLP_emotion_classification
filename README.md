# NLP_emotion_classification
Natural language processing (NLP) project (machine learning) for emotion classification in sentences. I used PyTorch module for solving this problem and also I used transformers module to get efficient model like DistilBERT (for much faster process in comparison with BERT). Actually I have solved the problem with 92% accuracy. Check jupyter notebook for watching the solution.
